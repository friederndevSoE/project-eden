I spent every Saturday night enjoying this game, usually for an hour or more after 10 pm. An ideal period, work is done, no one to disturb, quiet and peaceful.
10 hours of gameplay, around 2 months, headphones on, it gradually became a routine I enjoy. I sit down and just … play, no motive, no voice in the back of my head telling me to analyse and break everything down, just pure experience, not knowing a thing about genre, about Steam platform. Just a simple buy and play, nothing more.

Here comes another villain that comes out of nowhere, wants to stop our main guy because…..? And then he got kicked out of the story very easily and it made you question what the hell his role is in the overarching story. 

Here comes a very important character, another kind-hearted girl, and with her younger, chaotic friend added for chemistry purposes. I’m sure there is nothing wrong with this and there will be a happy ending for them, well, until she pulls out the "invites the other person to see a place that means a lot to her" trope.

Oh yeah, can’t forget the redeeming character, the wise one, etc… they are alright, I guess.`,

    text: `But since I was recommended twice for this game, I decided to follow it until the end and see what the fuss is all about.

…Glad to say that the end is very worth it. It kinda justifies every complaint I have had before. The first half of the game is constantly cave exploration and pressing buttons for lumen to flow. By exploring, you slowly get an idea of how everything functions in space. Areas that are hostile to you, people stop you midway and bully you for money, broken spaceships drifting in space, resources are scarce… 

Breaking in a facility and praying you get a good roll to gain resources, hijacking the communication system to save you from trouble, enjoying a casual singing moment here and there along the way… Even in outer space, the political system is just as oppressive as ever, you can barely do anything without breaking some rules here and there.

But despite all that, there is joy to be found, there is this absolute beauty of space that you can’t help but pause for a moment and enjoy the scenery. Amidst the chaos, your ship collects, grows, and sells flowers… Suddenly, I feel maybe flowers are not a nuisance after all.

The story picks up as you reach the 2nd half of the game, and you care more about the members traveling with you in the spaceship - the Red Chamber, you understand your shipmates more, their burden, problems just like anyone else, as well as why they decide to trust you. Things are more at stake, miscommunication and almost costing each other’s lives, the question of the genuine thing you want to pursue is looming.

The final chapters take themselves very seriously, you finally feel the TENSION, can’t help but finish everything then. I remember after finishing the final chapters, just lying down there until 3 am, thinking about the game, forming thoughts about what I want to say, reading some very niche discussions that barely anyone talks about: The one-way trip to that distant planet, the lumens, which is said to carry love and messages across time and space, the crash site with her lying down there, a 60-year promise, and as you have your final sprint toward the end, the scene before you… all the time you’ve been waiting for has led to this… finally, you can see the field of flowers.

OPUS Echo of Starsong, they obviously didn’t try to be anything more than what they set out to do. It's a simple story revolving around 2 beautiful souls that venture out to the depths of space, searching for something they set out for, and eventually find solace in each other's presence.`,

It’s been more than a year, and somehow, despite its gibberish vocals, it has weight and feels impactful for some reason. For a game that focuses on “Starsong”, it feels right in execution. This longing sadness, accompanied by the melody, never fails to remind me of the final scene, the complex emotion of reaching the end you long for, you should have known this, you should have expected this, yet… the alluring field, what you’ve been waiting to see, it feels .. heart-wrenching.`,

    text: `"For all the players completing the game, I would like to say from the bottom of my heart. Thank you
We hope our game gives you a heartfelt feeling and we hope our future project will help you feel the same.

Lastly, I would like to express wholeheartedly how difficult it is to make an indie game. Often time, it is not just about making quality game, you have to face fierce competition from the global market, and often, your competitor will have way more budget than you. How to generate attention from everyone becomes challenging and we ourselves haven't figured it out completely yet. 

So if this game resonates with you, I would like to ask you a favor to share this game to the people you know. Tell them it's worth a try and to us, that's the biggest support you can give to us.  We thank you once again."
