    text: `Visitor, welcome to the courtyard. This is the stage, the origin of everything here.

I approach gaming as an experience no different than reading a story or watching a movie. I want to focus on the story and the creative ways it is presented through this interactive art form.

A story immerses you in a whole new world where political oppression and propaganda linger on every corner, even as humanity has evolved to travel the stars. How everything is tied to a system with no hope of changing, eerily familiar, eerily real, you see the world the developer built in mind was extraordinary. 

A story that draws you into struggles, forcing you to confront trauma and guilt through choices that make your stomach uneasy, leaving you to question the silent battles some people have to face daily.

A story that quietly transports you back to your fond school days, reminds you of the friends and genuine connections you made. Every scene and interaction makes you remember the warmth inside, so much so that you wish to tell the world about it.


In a way, it’s the same as every other story you heard, and yet it’s not really so.

Here, you are the person who makes the decision, chooses, and interacts on your own. You reap the reward based on your action, reach the light at the end of the tunnel, but also bear the consequences should things go south.

Your choice and interaction make every feeling stronger than ever.

'Eden Courtyard' (name subject to change) [25.5.21]

    text: `I find joy knowing that across different lives, experiences, or wisdom, other souls, too, share the passion and authentic expression, pouring themselves into the story they want to tell. They manage to capture the heartfelt moment and tell a genuine tale, wrap it in a creative format called a game that can reach and inspire so many people.

This place, too, is built with the same desire, but I also aim for something more romantic, to preserve emotion and memories.

Maybe one day, the reason behind this project might no longer be true, the impact is no longer aligned with what it was intended, things will change, as everything always is… perhaps in a way I might not look forward to.

I wonder the day when its meaning is lost, does the flame engulf, or just slowly dissipates with time?

The courtyard should stay as it is.

If that day comes, I want to hear your “response” too. Is this the curtain call that I wish?`,

    text: `“I understand you... But are you really giving up on the next generation of humans?"
Eden smiled at Mobius, as if she were a naive and inquisitive child.

"Doctor, do you know what Elysia told me? She told me that the people of this era grew up listening to my songs. Doctor, my singing belongs to this era. I belong to this era. This is by no means foolish vanity or cowardly surrender. This is... a kind of faith. The next generation should script their own fate and sing their own songs. New stars will certainly rise. The songs of this era... will thrive and perish with this era."

Eden gave a slight nod to Mobius before drifting away into the wasteland with a smile. Mobius knew their conversation had ended. She was not in the least surprised by Eden's choice. She turned toward the base.

She suddenly heard an angelic song coming from behind. In the apocalyptic landscape where only debris and sand remained, it sounded like a gift from the heavens. Mobius looked back in surprise. It was Eden performing her last song to the vast heaven and earth.

...

Strange, Mobius had always thought her songs as nothing more than glorified noise. Then why did her heart now sting with grief? Is this … art?

No, that was not it. Mobius denied it to herself. She assessed the situation from a purely rational perspective. It was because she was watching an era wither away.

Before then, the collapse of an era was only an abstract concept to Mobius. It was only people dying out. It was only species becoming extinct.

But as she watched Eden disappear into the boundless wasteland, she felt something crumble for the first time. Eden's singing belonged to this era. Eden belonged to this era. Eden was the microcosm of this era.

Yet her song wafted closer and closer to death and the end of the world. It was the last time this beautiful voice resounded through the heavens and the earth…

Such heavenly music would never be heard again.
