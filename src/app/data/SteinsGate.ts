"Congratulations, by now you should have fully acclimatized to your new life onboard your ship. Remember to rely on your Replika to assist you in maintaining your vessel. We all wish you great success in your mission."

Cycle 1840
Everything is always the same. I feel like I'm trapped inside this ship. I know every bolt on every panel in every room of it. I've seen everything, I've done everything there is to do in here.
I can't concentrate on anything. It's like there's this fog inside my head, and whenever I try to do anything, I just can't focus. I want to go outside, I want to breathe fresh air, I want to feel wind on my face and in my hair.

Cycle 2503
I think I lost more hair. I'm sitting here, getting older. Every time I wake up, I feel older, weaker, sicker...

Cycle 3000
"Congratulations, Comrade! You've survived 3000 cycles.

If you have not found a suitable world for landing by this point, accept that you will not. Find solace in the thought that others might be successful where you failed.

Life support systems and reactor shielding will soon begin to fail, and radiation may begin to leak from the cooling system. We recommend you do not attempt to prolong your suffering by reusing old filters or rationing supplies.

Instead, make peace with your fate. We suggest that you ask your Replika, while it is still functional, to spare you a slow and agonizing death

Remember, you will die having served your Nation by partaking in a glorious demonstration of our power."

Cycle 53█9
I'm tired of it all. Every time I go to sleep, I wonder if I'll wake up again. I'm scared that it'll be the last time I said good night to her. Did I say it right? Will she be okay? What if one of us just won't wake up tomorrow?

Cycle 5██4.
I don't want to die, I don't want to live anymore either.
Everything is just so exhausting. I just want to lie down and disappear.

Cycle ███8
lost another tooth
there was so much blood
my hands were shaking
why is my hair falling out

i can't sleep
i just want to sleep
please just let me sleep
please, just make it stop

    text: `I find this title quite familiar when browsing through Steam. I think I saw this title - Steins Gate way back then in high school. I assume it's some classic due to the amount of memes and references, so obviously I set a high expectation immediately…. Surely it was a wise move to expect great things out of the gate?

Well it damn right surely does live up to the title of the best-rated visual novel of all time. That was a choice of Steins Gate.

Upon starting the game, you are greeted with an over-the-top main character whose half of whose dialogue you can barely understand, you wonder if you ever can take this guy seriously. But as you progress through the story, you ... still find him to be a little bit weird. This guy is unhinged and doesn’t seem to care about what the world thinks about him, that’s somewhat charming, isn’t it?

After you get all of that, just chill, relax, take it easy, let your guard down and watch as the latter part of the story will have you in a chokehold, take you on an emotional ride while hitting you in the guts at the same time.

    text: `Steins Gate's setting revolves around a bunch of tech-savvy teenagers trying to experiment and mess around for fun mostly. Fun and lighthearted, but by accident, they find out a way to compress message data to send it back in time, and eventually figure out a way to do the same with memory and consciousness. Everytime they tried to experiment with the past, the world around them also changed a bit, something felt just a little bit off, just a little bit different. Eventually, the looming threat you feel at the back of your mind and the consequences started to unfold. The friends who helped you, the people involved in your little experiment started to pay the price.`,

    text: `I don’t think Steins Gate is advertised as a philosophical story, it looks to be just a fun journey with charming over-the-top character archetypes with a passionate underlying science theme. The game didn’t try to bombard you with deep abstract message.

But this is why Steins Gate is so damn good, to the point of being acclaimed as a masterpiece.

The game is entertaining enough with the amusing characters’ interaction, and I’m sure people who visit this story without any expectation to seek anything profound would thoroughly enjoy it. But at the same time, it’s not possible not to notice how the cartoonish characters' personalities you feel before become more and more ‘real’ as you understand more about them throughout the story. Those genuine but flawed people feel like actual friends you want to have.

You never once presented a philosophical question, never once did the game demand you think and make a hard decision. It slowly builds itself up and lets you feel everything in such a natural way through the characters’ choice of making constant sacrifice, shouldering responsibility, being genuine or acting like it until shit hits the fan,... Each time-leap holds tremendous weight, and you feel the stress and desperation build up, as well as a temporary sense of relief and lingering doubt whether this action was worth it. Everything comes so naturally that I’m still struggling to point out which part does the story reveal itself to be so rich underneath.

You feel part of him slowly dies and you suddenly find yourself wanting to see more of the annoying personality you once deemed at the start.

It’s a fun, passionate story about science, it’s a concise, engaging story about fatalism and determinism`,

    text: `This game focuses on the ‘novel’ part. I can make an argument that there is little ‘game’ here since 99% of the time, you would be pressing the A button to forward to the next dialogue, with the last 1% is choosing your save slot. With no mini game or interesting gameplay mechanic to spice things up, just ... simply read the story, like a book.

A captivating book is a book you will fully enjoy and immerse yourself in regardless.

I fondly remember during the last arc, when I screamed internally and told myself how about let’s not fricking press the damn A button to forward to the next scene, like a child who can’t sit straight watching the tension unfold in his favourite TV show.

    text: `I've seen Steins Gate influence, a fellow friend who finds Okabe's personality cool and is inspired to live freely like him. How the story pulls a person out of their darkest period of their life, kick-starts a hobby, a Youtube channel career, gives courage, inspires viewers and players to live more genuinely…

It feels like a timeless piece of work that speaks to you at the core, the character you find annoying at the beginning turns out to be someone you respect and can’t help but be inspired by. A work that reveals layers of meaning and brings new appreciation when revisited in later years.

Oh yeah, one thing I will probably always look back fondly on is how this game gave me the final push to finish the ‘Gift’, it’s like I learn about his prequel, hands down one of the most impactful influences ever.

Are you working on a paper at an American research institute?
Are you pulling an all-nighter on an experiment to test an idea of yours?
Maybe you're still troubled by what happened with your father.
You have no memory of the three weeks you spent with me.
But that's okay.
Somewhere out there...
you're breathing, speaking, thinking hard about something...
That's all that matters.
Because somewhere out there you're looking at the same world I am...
...This world with an unknown future.

This is also a choice of Steins Gate.
