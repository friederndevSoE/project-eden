    text: `The wind caresses my cheek. I push down the pedal and begin to ascend the bridge with the sea breeze blowing. The spokes rhythmically revolve, reflecting rays of strong sunlight. Sweat oozes out of my every pore, but it's not unpleasant. It's actually quite healthy. It somehow reminds me of running around the school grounds back in my elementary days.
    
    I proposed this cycling activity as a change of pace from the search for an unfindable pin. Of course, I already know who the pin belongs to, and who ██████'s father is, but I dare not tell anyone. If at all possible, I want to spend these two days in peace and delay Suzuha's time travel. That became my current goal.
    
    "W-Where's some water?! Still no vending machine?! I could kill for a glass of water!" 
    
    "Sorry to say, but there's no convenience store untli we cross another bridge after this one" - I reply mechanically.

    "Okarin, you sure know your stuff. Have you been here before?" 

    "Yeah. Many times."

    Yes, I've been here many times. Many times, I've gone this way. 

    What cycle am I on today? I feel like I'm past 10. I'm endlessly repeating the same loop, as usual.

    █████'s attack?  ██████'s death? Those things won't happen for all eternity.

    At last, Daru seems to have used up the last of his strength. While still on his bike, he rests his upper half on the guardrail that divides the roadway and the footpath. There, I turn and park next to Daru's bike.

    "That's dangero--" 

    I swallowed my words. Thoughts too dark to be my own suddenly slipped into my mind.

    What would happen if I didn't pull Daru's arm? Would the expected happen? Would this sloppy body of Daru's get caught in the truck's body and get sent flying like a rag doll? Would his head or arm get blown off and his crimson blood gush everywhere? Would everyone scream after witnessing such an event?

    If I go back to the start of the loop, Daru won't even have a scratch. It doesn't matter how much blood he gushes, or how far his entrails come out. 

    Moreover, everyone needs a little spice in their life. An encounter with a splatter scene is necessary to arouse one's own survival instinct by invoking fear. If I keep soaking in these lukewarm days, I'd lose my motivation to seek peace.

    As far as these two days are concerned,

    I am God.

    A 48-hour eternity. I am the Creator of this paradise. 

    Tomorrow will be another good day for everyone.`,
