    text: `She was missing that night.
We looked everywhere… searched everywhere… shouted her name everywhere.
Yet not a single trace of her.
Not even a trail, a shadow, a ghost.

It’s been a long time since it rained like this
“Ah, I love the touch of raindrop sliding down my face”
I never knew what she meant by that
But I’m content the night sky was showering rain for her

The heavy rain tells me you are there, but at the same time, you’re nowhere

A million cries and hours have passed
I finally surrender at last
I ran as far as I could
Like she told me I should

Until eventually
I found myself missing

Within me, I looked everywhere
Searched everywhere
Shouted my name everywhere
Yet not a single trace of me

It felt like the world had ended, but a part of me wants to believe that… the world hasn’t ended yet.`,

You still wake up from your small bedroom, you still go to school, meet your friends, hang out, grind games, try to deal with homework… doing just enough to get by, but from time to time, you are drawn to the piano in the corner of the room and practice a song you have long forgotten.
… Something is off. You notice people around you disappear, people experience memories that weren’t theirs, deja vu? Then you meet someone, friends who will set off a chain reaction that explains everything.

    text: `This is the type of game that will make its way to your dream the night after you first played it. I'm glad the dream was spot on.

Usually I would look at Steam’s review and watch some gameplay before deciding to purchase. Same story for this one. Everything checked out except the fact I got so hooked that I accidentally watched an entire first hour of playthrough instead of the usual 10 minutes. And I also have to spend another solid hour to download and catch up with the playthrough.

Until Then is the game that will instantly take you back to your school days, you got yourself a well-behaved class monitor, a guy who is always sleeping, artsy guys and gals, people with actual taste, the antisocial as well as the social butterfly, you got the sporty guy, the uptight person as well as the hopeless romantic... You see the same classroom and school corridor painted in yellow, the school poster for the upcoming prom, and you complain since it costs money and demands a weird dresscode... You got a presentation with slides you haven’t finished, you got the feeling of dread seeing everyone prepared their work while you completely forgot, you rush it in to turn it in, too tired afterward, and slept through a whole class…

You go everywhere and do pretty much anything as a normal highschool student, visit your friend’s chess tournament, go to a festival with your homies, ride the Ferris Wheel, take a walk in the mall to find clothes, just standing there idly waiting for the bus, meet up just to gossip, talking behind eachother’s back and scheme things that would turn the class against you if found out, getting to class early to peek at your test score,.. the world is colorful.

Every scene in Until Then is crafted with love, from the sunset where you are filming with your friends, to going to the studio to cheer your guy up. The dark kitchen in your house you barely use and no one ever uses, much less cleans it. The new home where a friend just moved in, with stuff lying all around. The school laboratory with gibberish still on the blackboard…. They feel real, they feel human and make you want to let yourself loose in the world.

That’s what you will see through the eyes of a student, but you slowly notice things are weird.

Many road closures when visiting certain places, people acting crazy on the street, telling you the end is coming, you see complaints and conspiracies about the government with the new rules on your newfeed more and more, some of your classmates went missing. It’s getting… worse.

The street is always dirty with trash everywhere you go, the air is polluted, public transportation is crowded. The hospital always seems to be overloaded, patients having their beds in the hallway, doctors are always on the move, the scene feels like a concentration camp instead of a medical facility. 

We care about our lives and only occasionally glance at the world. But everything we perceive eventually points to a bigger problem, corrupted government, the gap between the poor and the rich, people suffering daily.

At this point, you realize this is not a simple, mundane school life game. There are issues and worries, there are things beyond your understanding. Amidst the chaos, you still have your own problem, the current way you are living, the guilt you have yet to overcome, the uncomfortable truth you have not yet faced, the cold, lonely sight of your home at night after school doesn’t seem to get any better.

Despite being a 'novel', the game provides you with tons of minigames and interesting gameplay mechanics to make your experience more fun and engaging: running in the hallway, playing games at the carnival, scaring children away and just simply riding bicycles under the setting sun...`,

    text: `You have a piano show tomorrow, there is a song, you don’t remember where it comes from, you want to play it, you constantly mess it up, and forget midway, you want to give up multiple times before, again and again, you still find it in your heart to go back to it. Why? Why shouldn’t you settle for the minimal effort? With a special help from that person, maybe finally, you will play the whole thing for her… Something deep down you have always wanted to try, try not to settle for the status quo. 

The night before the show, you got a chance to practice, to familiarize yourself with the mechanics, a piano minigame you might say. I remember that night, I was heavily invested and spent a shit ton of time just playing every single song available, even songs that aren’t important for tomorrow's big show. They are casual songs just to warm you up, the type of beginner songs you heard hundreds of times before, but that moment, everything was so catchy, I got in the flow and focused on feeling every single piano note. Lying on the bed, the desire and reason to play an instrument, I felt it again.`,

    text: `You wake up after a long night, but not in your usual room, instead you find yourself lying on the ground of your classroom. Bed sheets everywhere, buckets of water, everything is so messy.

All of the residents in your area have to evacuate to the school, the road on the street crumbles and it’s no longer safe for anyone to travel and go about their everyday life. Education, work are cancelled until everything is settled down.

You are still here, safe, you can still meet your friends, you still chat about mundane things.

We will have a shipment of the flour today, Cathy said. Let me bake cookies for you guys.

People… still smile, chat about everyday life, talk about their future goals and look after one another.

It’s not safe to be here, another classmate said. Is that so? Why do you care? Is it wrong to be here? I'm tired of moving constantly, it’s gonna be the same no matter what. Just leave me alone, let me be here one last time.

People… give up, running away is tiring, they want to rest, everywhere things were destroyed, unsafe, they instead choose to visit home one last time. 

Same adversity, people react so differently yet no less authentically, they are right, it is haunting, at this point, it doesn’t feel like fiction anymore, the hardship, the struggle, it is eerily .. real.

You want to make more money to support your family, but can you bear to see your child more and more alone?
Are you happy for you friends when they grow? Or would you secretly hoping they would fail so you can hang out forever?
Would you choose to cling to hope, still looking forward to getting the next shipment of flour? Or would you rather pay the place you call home one last visit?
Can you move on? Why?

Has the world ended yet?

If there exists a game that I would recommend to all of my friends, anyone, everyone, shove this game into their throat regardless of their gaming experience and beginner barrier, it would be Until Then.

It's inviting, it’s touching, it's relatable, it’s wholesome, it’s also haunting and it’s damn right very authentic.

It makes you truly appreciate how the story was told through this interactive art medium.

Go buy this damn game the hell are you waiting for? The story is god damn GENERATIONAL!!!!!!!

If you find this piece of writing moving, maybe some part of it speaks to you and blossoms into some small desire to play the game after reading this. Maybe I’ll seriously consider buying this game for you.`,
