Eden: Miss Raiden, you should have looked up to the starry night sky sometimes, right?
Mei: Yes, only less and less.
Eden: Ah... I can relate to that. Watching the stars... Requires suitable companions. But when we look up to the stars, they're not there anymore. Most of them have long perished... The light our eyes catch is from tens of thousands of years ago. But still, this never diminishes their brilliance....

    text: `This is probably the hardest game to write about, it's been years since I finished it, and I wonder whether I can retain the knowledge, emotion and impression accurately enough or the impression holds enough weight to leave a faithful and authentic 'review'? Or shouldn’t I hold that standard and just write what I feel at the present moment?

Time passed, impression changed, discovering more layers while forgetting some. Some stay and stick well, some become fuzzy and harder to recollect. It feels somewhat a bit less authentic to sit on it too long and write about the stuff I don’t vividly remember.

I started writing this as a regular review, but after weeks of constant revisions, this game deserves something a little bit different.`,

    text: `Mihoyo, around this time, they are huge, you can’t fathom their influence, and the money they are making through this deceptive gambling gatcha system. Who knows what you will change when “you” read this? Maybe they fall from grace? Is the company finally public? The next EA and Blizzard, or still just a Chinese gaming company that happens to know exactly what appeals to the masses.

But let’s step back for a bit, to a more peaceful time, where they created this game that deserved a spot here. Did this game give birth to this specific project idea and shape its concept to begin with? Maybe.

It was the time when you felt the company prioritized passion and love, rather than market trends and what work for the masses. People in charge care, sprinkle their effort even in trivial things such as maintenance messages, mailbox letters, characters’ birthday CG,... they were brimming with love.

The cheesy dialogue they wrote, the clumsy art they drew that heavily depends on 3D modelling, the songs they composed, everything was so … raw and human, we had work of art, compare to glorified promotional materials.

Honkai Impact 3rd. So what even is the Honkai? Honkai is something that grows along with civilization, the more advanced the civilization, the stronger the honkai becomes. No one knows where it comes from, to what extent it will stop, but it seems to do one thing only, to destroy mankind… I think? The concept lost its meaning ages ago, even in-game, and even more when it was slapped on many different games with no substance behind it.

The setting of Honkai Impact 3rd couldn't be simpler: cute girls fighting monsters. Like every shounen story there is, they learn about fighting for something other than themselves, about the cost of sacrifice, about choosing to live on for the sake of others. They learn to fight and to protect, they grow, mature and finally graduate.

    text: `This is a gatcha game, most gamers would be very familiar with this type of game and its live service nature.

With every gatcha game, the end experience is similar to burning out, whether you notice an aggressive monetary strategy from the company or making decisions that clearly focus on squeezing money out of your pocket rather than the playing experience. Gradually, the grinding makes you sick, the constant loop of chasing new content and flashy characters tires you out, and it ends in resentment.

But this is the first time I treated it like a console game, meta, powercreep, grinding, limited events, daily log-in, these things are just secondary. Literally didn’t give a shit about a game mode just because it doesn’t follow the chronological story order. The story comes first, and when it’s finished, I close it, like closing a book.

    text: `Steins Gate's setting revolves around a bunch of tech-savvy teenagers trying to experiment and mess around for fun mostly. Fun and lighthearted, but by accident, they find out a way to compress message data to send it back in time, and eventually figure out a way to do the same with memory and consciousness. Everytime they tried to experiment with the past, the world around them also changed a bit, something felt just a little bit off, just a little bit different. Eventually, the looming threat you feel at the back of your mind and the consequences started to unfold. The friends who helped you, the people involved in your little experiment started to pay the price.`,

    text: `I don’t think Steins Gate is advertised as a philosophical story, it looks to be just a fun journey with charming over-the-top character archetypes with a passionate underlying science theme. The game didn’t try to bombard you with deep abstract message.

But this is why Steins Gate is so damn good, to the point of being acclaimed as a masterpiece.

The game is entertaining enough with the amusing characters’ interaction, and I’m sure people who visit this story without any expectation to seek anything profound would thoroughly enjoy it. But at the same time, it’s not possible not to notice how the cartoonish characters' personalities you feel before become more and more ‘real’ as you understand more about them throughout the story. Those genuine but flawed people feel like actual friends you want to have.

You never once presented a philosophical question, never once did the game demand you think and make a hard decision. It slowly builds itself up and lets you feel everything in such a natural way through the characters’ choice of making constant sacrifice, shouldering responsibility, being genuine or acting like it until shit hits the fan,... Each time-leap holds tremendous weight, and you feel the stress and desperation build up, as well as a temporary sense of relief and lingering doubt whether this action was worth it. Everything comes so naturally that I’m still struggling to point out which part does the story reveal itself to be so rich underneath.

You feel part of him slowly dies and you suddenly find yourself wanting to see more of the annoying personality you once deemed at the start.

It’s a fun, passionate story about science, it’s a concise, engaging story about fatalism and determinism`,

    text: `This game focuses on the ‘novel’ part. I can make an argument that there is little ‘game’ here since 99% of the time, you would be pressing the A button to forward to the next dialogue, with the last 1% is choosing your save slot. With no mini game or interesting gameplay mechanic to spice things up, just ... simply read the story, like a book.

A captivating book is a book you will fully enjoy and immerse yourself in regardless.

I fondly remember during the last arc, when I screamed internally and told myself how about let’s not fricking press the damn A button to forward to the next scene, like a child who can’t sit straight watching the tension unfold in his favourite TV show.

    text: `I've seen Steins Gate influence, a fellow friend who finds Okabe's personality cool and is inspired to live freely like him. How the story pulls a person out of their darkest period of their life, kick-starts a hobby, a Youtube channel career, gives courage, inspires viewers and players to live more genuinely…

It feels like a timeless piece of work that speaks to you at the core, the character you find annoying at the beginning turns out to be someone you respect and can’t help but be inspired by. A work that reveals layers of meaning and brings new appreciation when revisited in later years.

Oh yeah, one thing I will probably always look back fondly on is how this game gave me the final push to finish the ‘Gift’, it’s like I learn about his prequel, hands down one of the most impactful influences ever.

Are you working on a paper at an American research institute?
Are you pulling an all-nighter on an experiment to test an idea of yours?
Maybe you're still troubled by what happened with your father.
You have no memory of the three weeks you spent with me.
But that's okay.
Somewhere out there...
you're breathing, speaking, thinking hard about something...
That's all that matters.
Because somewhere out there you're looking at the same world I am...
...This world with an unknown future.

This is also a choice of Steins Gate.
