I see principles as rigid shackles
Weak principles, they're too loose to be of value
Strong principles hold you down
Sometimes 'principles' are excuses to indulge one's self "If I'm adhering to a certain principle, it must be OK if I do that."

Whever we make decision, we do so by going with what we think is right at that specific time ... as long as your deed serves your purpose, your pursuit....

Every choice I made is a weight informed decision, so instead of creating universal principles, I judge every situation on a separte case.
My decisions are made based on the 'value' I assigned to everything. But 'value' fluctuates all the time
It's not possible to take into account every single factor

My own set of principles, anyone can argue against them, they are based on my own standard, not social convention.

I keep doubting myself, all the time, every now and then, I adjust my concept of "right". The stress is constant, but that doubt is what makes me feel assured. If I’m doubting myself, I can adapt and improve.

    text: `I never thought a game like this could exist.

Discussing philosophical topics is uninviting and feels pretentious at times. It requires lots of effort to get to the zone and think, it requires you to look past your own relatability and make judgments yourself.

Focusing too much on the fun stuff dilutes the core message.
Focusing too much on the abstract debate drives you away.

But this game did it, for some god damn reason, it was able to pull it off. It invites you, appeals to you, makes you care about it, then slowly reveals its essence and lets you naturally think.

Do you want to live a normal, peaceful life? Or do you want to go out of your way to do good? Such a simple question and also complicated with strings of ‘it depends’ intertwined together.

What was my experience? Wanting to relax after a long working day? LOL. This game goes above and beyond and gives you a literal part-time job, puts you in dilemmas, and makes you second-guess your choices.

Ever since the beginning of the game, you have been presented with the opposing idea between living in a peaceful bubble and sacrificing yourself for something greater.

Naturally, the game leads you through a series of events that constantly unfold.
Your idea of a peaceful life got shaken, you started to see things not so black and white, you sense something bigger and more sinister. What happened to the factory you work for? To all the ill people signing up? Why does the boss fake something to ‘test’ you? Why is the other division making such a complicated issue?

What would you do when you finally saw it spiraling out of control?

You slowly unpack each layer and layer, and see how ugly, tainted everything is, the world is rotten to the core. Deep down, you know you should do something, you should… do more. This is unacceptable. But must you?

‘How can this be any worse?’ you might ask yourself. Before you know it, you realize your life will never be back to the way it was.

The questions you get at the beginning suddenly seem… out of reach.`,

    text: `Even in the future, even when our life is filled with technology to make everything more convenient, we are still the same, still have to work, still have to provide, still carry the same responsibility and dreams. 

We are.. still at the mercy of big corporations, people in higher power, chained to a greedy system that never seems to change. Human and their ideas still struggle in the rawest form.

You, yes you too, a nobody, an unknown person with no say or power, your loved one gets hurt… badly, almost got herself killed. Immediately get up and fight for them? Play the long game and overthrow the men behind it? Calculate the most damage while considering the well-being of other people? Letting the responsible get away to spare society a longer way out?

Any choice could be right… What is your right? You tried to make the best choice you could. There is no perfect choice, only the most correct one. The world is ugly, there is no silver lining to save the day, only you, fighting both the world and your inner self

This is real life, there is no happy ending. Everything you work for, every choice you make, has to be calculated and considered with utmost care. Making compromises, making sacrifices, … to reach your right ending.`,

A person who wanted to live a quiet life
A person who wanted to support their partner
A person who wanted to be able to provide for his family
A person who wanted to do justice
A person who wanted to do good things
A person who wanted to do good things no matter what

No hero to save the day, no salvation, no grand revolution, just simple people doing things in their power, to make the world where they live more bearable.`,

We make excuses, we try to justify our own decision, we rarely uphold ourselves to a standard and eventually everything just slips right through and we again make excuses.

It's incredible to sit down and think that somewhere in China, an unknown small studio with no other published products manages to understand the essence, capture the underlying aspect of life, design a compelling narrative, combined with charming dialogue, relatable characters to create this god damn masterpiece of a game.`,

If you pull some bullshit, well, at least ... I would know him a bit better.
