I was able to collect some new data. Though this experiment ... still ended in failure.
I want to let her keep living. Do machines... lack that mindset?
____________________________

Why do you create me, Doctor?
Because I wanted a friend, I guess.
A friend... Do you not have any human friends, Doctor?
Nope, I don't. Not a single one
...
But now. I've gained something more important than a friend. And as a result, my life's a happy one.
____________________________

And now... in 100 years... I'll be able to meet Utsuwa. So now, my current self... will die. This is for the best... this is.....
Ah, I wanted to live... just a little more
I wanted to play with Utsuwa a little more..
Just a little longer....

Why am I crying? Who are you?
____________________________

I can't do it, erasing the memories of me... Making those happy days with you never have happened...
There's no way I could do it...
It's pathetic, but
Even if it's just a bit longer....

... I feel the same way. We only have a little time left, so... Until the end.... I'll be with you until the end.

Who are you?
What is your personality?
You want to find out, you have to finish the test for the doctor. So you go and explore, interact with everything and talk to everyone you can.

But despite how you embark on your journey, all the people you choose to interact with, the people you ignore, give money to, save, etc….

You face the same problem as any human would, you ... make a choice beyond the layer of personalities.`,

    text: `When I finished Refind Self, I found burning questions popping up inside my head, so I decided to spend the next afternoon digging around.

With so many different playstyles, do they all reach the same path at the end? If so, why? 
This surely points to a higher conscience? What exactly is this? Responsibility? Hope? Principles? Is it born with or nurtured through the right environment? Can it be reproduced? Where does this feel most noticeable? Past or present? Hardship or peace? Do people default to not considering it unless some important events happen that push them to act?

On the surface, Refine Self is a personality test game. A charming, short, simple one that will take you no more than an hour for a run. You make your charming choice: go to the shrine, give food to the child or the parents, keep on digging coins, give it to people in need, be a bartender, explore the lab, jump off a building, etc… and eventually make a choice, a ‘you’ choice. Your curiosity and playstyle will shape the result and you can compare it and see how you stand among others.

But I’m sure, no matter what result you get, you will reach the same roadblock, you will think and consider something, whatever choice you made, will be unlikely based on your personality anymore. Just cherish the last moment with someone important, just forget all about them, reach a future where you can both meet again, just keep the promise.

The desire of wanting, truly wish for the best, to wish someone to live on, is just as strong, authentic, and respectable as the desire of wanting to end. Both are valid, both are right, both are worth pursuing until the end.

Utsuwa, on her own, can never choose to do it.`,

    text: `This world lacks human touches, this world is tinted in yellow, it’s cold, and you don’t see a way out.

… And it’s not a bad place to spend my final moments. Look at the vast sky with broken clouds, go to the lighthouse, visit the casino, the cafe, and sit on a bench aimlessly. Explore the lab, head down to the basement, and interact with everything there. Visit the grave, feel the colors. Take a walk in the path toward the shrine, go inside the cold cave to finally come out and see the sea, walk along the endless shore, cast a gaze to the infinite ocean's stretch… one last time.

Only indie games can do this, only they can have the guts to tell such a narrative, something that might not appeal to the masses, something controversial that will soothe a dying soul, to accept it and follow it as the most natural and most correct one.
