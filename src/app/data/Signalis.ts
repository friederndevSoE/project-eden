"Congratulations, by now you should have fully acclimatized to your new life onboard your ship. Remember to rely on your Replika to assist you in maintaining your vessel. We all wish you great success in your mission."

Cycle 1840
Everything is always the same. I feel like I'm trapped inside this ship. I know every bolt on every panel in every room of it. I've seen everything, I've done everything there is to do in here.
I can't concentrate on anything. It's like there's this fog inside my head, and whenever I try to do anything, I just can't focus. I want to go outside, I want to breathe fresh air, I want to feel wind on my face and in my hair.

Cycle 2503
I think I lost more hair. I'm sitting here, getting older. Every time I wake up, I feel older, weaker, sicker...

Cycle 3000
"Congratulations, Comrade! You've survived 3000 cycles.

If you have not found a suitable world for landing by this point, accept that you will not. Find solace in the thought that others might be successful where you failed.

Life support systems and reactor shielding will soon begin to fail, and radiation may begin to leak from the cooling system. We recommend you do not attempt to prolong your suffering by reusing old filters or rationing supplies.

Instead, make peace with your fate. We suggest that you ask your Replika, while it is still functional, to spare you a slow and agonizing death

Remember, you will die having served your Nation by partaking in a glorious demonstration of our power."

Cycle 53█9
I'm tired of it all. Every time I go to sleep, I wonder if I'll wake up again. I'm scared that it'll be the last time I said good night to her. Did I say it right? Will she be okay? What if one of us just won't wake up tomorrow?

Cycle 5██4.
I don't want to die, I don't want to live anymore either.
Everything is just so exhausting. I just want to lie down and disappear.

Cycle ███8
lost another tooth
there was so much blood
my hands were shaking
why is my hair falling out

i can't sleep
i just want to sleep
please just let me sleep
please, just make it stop

You wake up, you know nothing 
You have to find a girl
You don't know her
You don't know where she is
You don't know where the hell you are
You don't know why creatures are attacking you 
You find documents, notes, pieces of information scattered, you try to connect the dots, but you don't know anything
You finish the game, and you still don't know anything 
You know nothing
You spent several hours watching video essay on YouTube and you finally know a little bit more`,

A replika chasing a memory that doesn't belong to her, trapped in a circle of annihilation, clinging to a promise.
A person who is suffering, falling apart mentally and physically, yearning for the death promise granted by the one she loved.

It's a story about a dystopian future, political oppression, guilt, and existential meaning
It's a story about guilt, loss, and love

I scrolled a bit down below, and a single Steam comment convinced me to try this game out. That comment said this game has an insanely rich lore and world-building, no damn kidding, players won’t be able to break everything down just by playing it in one go. You would naturally want to watch a full 1 hour 30 minutes video breakdown that explains every intricate detail of what Signalis has to offer.

Turns out he lied, because I watched ~6 hours of videos in total... on the first 2 days... and maybe still counting.

    text: `In the world of mindless games that give you dopamine at every turn, Signalis demands you to think, connect pieces of the puzzles, and realize the full story yourself, no handholding, no annoying magical guide, you get the understanding through subtext, very much it complements the setting of the game. It’s like it proudly says: if you don’t bother, don’t intend to use your brain, you can go.

When you get an item, key, safecode, document,... It's always feedback to another puzzle and leads you to another valuable piece of information, a tightly fit resources system that 
strikes a perfect balance. Solving the puzzle is extremely satisfying, you feel like a damn genius after every successful attempt, it feels earned. The game masterfully guides you through the next action while slowly showing you information about its world.

    text: `Signalis's interactive nature complements the theme of being stuck in struggle and hopelessness. Every room you go to, every backtracking, to save, to recover items, armor, checking if you missed anything - everything is well planned. While I'm not a horror fan, this deep dive of exploration was indeed very fulfilling in every step.

This can only be felt through actively engaging with it, by playing the game. I didn't plan for the courtyard to have this genre, but to my own surprise, in the end, I'm very glad to be wrong.

Its story shines when showcasing the struggle, a soul doing everything to reach the promise. Navigating through this confusing world and only left you with questions, yet still you push through, you have to go, you have to fight, you are confused, you are hurt, everything is so fuzzy taht you can barely keep you sanity, there were you who have already tried and failed…. 

Yet you have to go, she is calling you.

The world makes your struggle real, it amplifies your journey and pulls you in every second of it, only the world this authentic makes you want to care, makes you want to walk just a bit further.

Does pursuing your goal make everything fall apart? Does pursuing your goal make more people suffer as a byproduct? Can you do it?

Perhaps this truly is hell...
